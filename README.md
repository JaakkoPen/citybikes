This project is focused on analysing Helsinki City bike data with R programming and Python. The scripts include functions which calculate the most used bike stations,
the most frequent trip between two stations and the longest trips made by bike users. In the .ipynb file you can see how the code is executed. The source data is freely accesible and can be found from HSL.fi.
